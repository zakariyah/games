              <h1>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN NON-BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.</h1>
              <p>Please read the terms of the following consent form carefully before procedding.</p>
              <br/><br/>[Human Dynamics in Social Games]
              <br/><br/> You are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Iyad Rahwan of the MIT media lab, Dr Talal Rahwan and  Dr. Jacob Crandall, from the Computing and Information Science Program at the Masdar Institute. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a willing volunteer. You should read the information below before deciding whether or not to participate.
              <br/><br/>
              - PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL
              <br/><br/> Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind. Also, the investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.  
              <br/><br/>
              - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
              <br/><br/> The purpose of this study is to investigate how different factors (e.g. social, or environmental) affect human reasoning and decision-making in different scenarios. The research will also help us design better systems that support human reasoning and decision-making both individually and in groups.
              <br/><br/>
              - OVERVIEW
              <br/><br/> If you volunteer to participate in this study,you will receive a tutorial briefing on the game you will play. You will also have to answer a brief quiz that ensures you understand the game rules and experiment procedures before playing an unknown number of rounds. A round consists of two stages â€“ action and review stage. In each round, you accumulate a score measured in terms of points.
              After a certain number of rounds, the session ends. You will be presented with a summary screen informing you of your total score and how the score translates to monetary reward.
              
              - POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
              <br/><br/>
              Some participants may feel some discomfort if other players are not behaving as they expected. If participants do not perform well in the game, they may also feel some frustration. Note that all participants are anonymous to each other, so no one will be able to identify you. If you do experience discomforts and risks of any kind, you are free to withdraw from the study.
              <br/><br/>
              - POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
              <br/><br/>
              We hope that you enjoy your participation in the study. We anticipate that this study will also benefit society by helping us all to better understand how to design better systems to support human reasoning and decision making in an increasingly connected world. You will also receive a monetary reward based on your participation in the game.
              - PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION
              <br/><br/>
              Your compensation consists of two elements of both show-up fee and bonus.
              <br/> Show-up fee is a  fixed show-up fee of <%= currency %><%= reward %> will be given to you. This fee will be paid regardless of performance in the game, provided you stay until the end of the session. If you choose to leave before the completion of the game, you will not be paid as the completion code for payment is only given at the end of the game.
              <br/>Bonus (a.k.a. Reward): This is an additional amount, up to <%= currency %><%= maxbonus %>, awarded based on your performance (i.e. number of points you accumulate).
              <br/><br/>
              - CONFIDENTIALITY
              <br/><br/>
              Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Additionally, all information gathered will not be tied to your name. All electronic information will be stored on a password-protected computer.
              <br/><br/>
              
              
              - RIGHTS OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS
              <br/>
              You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.  If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact:

              <h1>Instructions.</h1>
              <p> As a participant in this experiment, you will play a simple game consisting of a number of rounds with an algorithm. You are matched with an algorithm  across all rounds within a given game.
              </p>

              <p class="alert alert-success">Payoff Structure</p><table class='table table-bordered table-condensed'><tr><th>Option</th> <th>You will get</th> <th>The algorithm  will get</th> </tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choiceAction" id='first' checked='checked' value="1"> A: </td><td>-2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td><input type="radio" name="choiceAction" id='second' value="2"> B: </td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

              <p >Each round of the game consists of 2 stages. In the action (first) stage, you and the algorithm  will be offered a choice (individually) between two options as shown above. The payoff you receive at the end of each round depends on the options that both you and the other player chose. Your payoff in each round of the game is thus the sum of your payoff from your chosen option and your payoff from the other player's chosen option. You choose an option by clicking the radio button labelled 'A' or 'B'. You must select your option before the timer runs out. If you do not do so, a random option will be chosen for you and you will not be paid for that round. You have 20 seconds to make a decision.</br>
              <br/>For Example, if you choose A and the other player chooses A, you will get -2 + 5 = 3.

              <p>In the review (second) stage, both you and the other player are presented with the options chosen in the previous stage. You are also shown the payoff you received from your chosen action, the payoff you received from the other player's chosen option and your resulting total score. The cumulative total score at the end of all rounds is multiplied by $0.01 to give your total bonus. You will be given 10 seconds to reflect on the result after which a new round starts automatically. The <span class="badge">R</span>  indicates that the you did not choose anything within the time frame</p>

              <h1>Comprehension Questions</h1>
              <p> You will now answer 2 short questions to show that you understood the instructions and how to play the game. After answering successfully, you will be placed in a waiting room where you will wait until you are assigned another participant to play the game with. The game will start as soon as a partner has joined the game, at which point a beep will alert you. Once a game has started, leaving the game before the final summary screen will result in you not getting paid AT ALL.
              </p>Please note the two circumstances which could make you forfeit your entire payment:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Once in the waiting room, you leave the waiting room before the waiting room timer runs out.</li>
              <li>Once in a game, you stop or close a game at any time before the final payment screen.</li></p>
